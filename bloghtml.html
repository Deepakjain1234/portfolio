                As a blogger seeking to make passive income online, affiliate marketing is,<br> one of the most popular
                methods in the world to help you reach your goal.,<br>

                There are tried and tested ways to make it work for you.,<br>

                If you’re just starting out, don’t worry as this guide has everything you need ,<br> to know about
                affiliate marketing.

                Ready? Let’s dive in.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h1>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                Affiliate marketing is the process in which you earn a commission for promoting a product,<br> or
                service the belongs to another person or company.

                In other words, you find a product or<br> service that , interests you, promote it to other people and
                earn a fraction <br> of the profit whenever someone buys the product.


            </p>
            <img class="img2" src="photo/blogimg2.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The cost of buying a service or product through an affiliate is similar to that of buying <br> it
                directly
                from the owner of the product. ,<br>

                Product owners must pay affiliates a percentage of the sales as a commission, which ,<br> means they
                probably
                make less money per sale.<br>

                However, product owners gain more because an affiliate helps them to reach more potential customers (and
                make more sales) than they’d have done on their own.

                So, it’s a win-win
            </p>
            <h1>First: Merchant</h1>
            <img class="img2" src="photo/mar1.png" alt="">
            <p>The merchant is also referred to as the advertiser, seller, brand, vendor, retailer, or

                It’s the party that creates the product. It can be a single person or a big, Fortune 500 company.
                Anyone can be the vendor behind an affiliate marketing program.

                Merchants don’t necessarily have to be actively involved. All they need is a product to sell.</p>

            <h1>Second: Affiliate</h1>
            <img class="img2" src="photo/mar2.png" alt="">
            <p>Also known as the publisher, associate or partner, an affiliate can also be a single person or an entire
                company. Affiliates can generate a few hundreds of dollars per month or tens of millions in commission.

                An affiliate plays the marketing role by promoting one or several affiliate products. The party attracts
                and convinces potential buyers of the product’s value so they can end up purchasing it.</p>

            <h1>Third: Consumer</h1>
            <img class="img2" src="photo/mar3.png" alt="">
            <p>his party makes the entire affiliate system to go round. Without sales in sight, there won’t be revenue
                to share or commissions to give out.

                The affiliate will make efforts to market to customers using any suitable channel whether it’s a digital
                billboard, social network or content marketing on blogs.</p>

            <h1>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work?</h1>
            <p>First off, you should find the product or company you’d like to promote.

                Start by finding a service or product you know is relevant to your blog’s niche and one that your
                audience will find useful.

                My quick 1-minute video will be of great help. Watch it below!<br>Next, you should partner with the
                merchant by signing up for their affiliate program. This will make you an affiliate.

                After joining their affiliate program, you’ll be given a unique affiliate ID to be included in all the
                affiliate links you post on your site to promote the service or product.

                You can promote the product in several ways including recommending it in articles, writing product
                reviews, sending email newsletters or displaying banner ads. Your merchant will use the unique affiliate
                ID to track all the traffic you direct to their website.</p>
                <img src="photo/mar4.png" alt="">
                <p>When a user buys a product, you earn a commission. The merchant issues your payment when the earnings reach a set threshold, and this can be anywhere between 45 and 60 days.

                    Google Trends shows an increased interest of 15% in the term ‘affiliate marketing’ between April 2018 and March 2019 (see the diagram below).
                    
                    According to Awin, 81% of brands in the United States use this strategy, and if trends are anything to go by, this figure will increase. Everyone is responding to it!
